What does it mean to create a Docker image and why do we use Docker images?
Creating a docker image is packaging an application and its dependencies 
into a special format that can be used by Docker or similar container engine.

We use docker images as a way to deploy applications in a repeatable way. The docker image
can work on a cloud or run with a container orchestration tool.

Please explain what is the difference from a Container vs a Virtual Machine?

A container is the encapsulation of an application, it is smaller, and runs faster than a VM. 
A VM is an encapsulation of a full operating system, it is bigger and more powerful, but is
generally slower to run than a container.

What are 5 examples of container orchestration tools (please list tools)?
Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Rancher, Amazon EC2 Container Service, Google Kubernetes EngineÂ 

How does a Docker image differ from a Docker container?
The docker image is the packaged format of the application. The container is the running
instantiation of the image and has state, so the container is what actual runs and is
active (e.g. acts as the application and is connected to). The docker image is like
a base image/template of what is instatiated as the running container.
